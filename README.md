# Runtime Analysis

# Insert Operation: O(log n)
The time complexity is O(log n) because the Red-Black Tree stays balanced. Finding the right spot and fixing the tree after insertion involves a few rotations or recoloring, which are quick.

# Search Operation: O(log n)
The time complexity is O(log n) since the tree’s height is always logarithmic, making it fast to find a node by traversing only a few levels.

Balancing:
The tree remains balanced by following rules like no two red nodes being adjacent, keeping operations efficient. This ensures both insert and search stay O(log n).
